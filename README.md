This is the source notes of raw markdown notes to be published to the til website.

TODO - add github for the website code

Usage notes to future me:
- if we change the pathname in Obsidian we need to update this in the `obsidian-git` plugin settings (update both `Custom base path` and `Custom Git Directory path`)
	- currently `01-99-Personal/30-49-Projects/37b-TIL-website/TIL-source`
 - if we change the github repo name we need to update the obsidian-exporter-helper script settings
