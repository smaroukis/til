TIL how to prevent Goodreads books from showing up to your timeline when you add to e.g. a "Want to Read" shelf (for example for bulk adding), without making a private account.

Go to the following settings page at: <https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=feeds> and uncheck the "Add a book to your shelves"

Note that now friends can still see all the titles you have added to your shelf, but it won't clog up the timeline.
